5.the core game design concept
"In the game, numerous enemies spawn, and over time, they grow increasingly powerful. Defeated
enemies drop experience points, which players collect to enhance their abilities and level up. The
skill acquisition system allows for gaining a new skill at every level, every two levels, or dynamically.
The core gameplay features two main elements: 1. Streamer control over the character, and 2. Player
expectations and engagement. Players can support the streamer by boosting the characterâ€™s abilities
or challenge them by enhancing the attributes, types, and numbers of monsters. The game promotes
continuous exploration, enabling players to develop unique styles through skill point allocation, thus
boosting character attributes. The thrill of the game comes from the ability to clear a screen full of
enemies swiftly, offering players a gratifying clear-screen experience. Moreover, viewers can interact
by deploying new and unique monsters, increasing the game's challenge. Longer game sessions yield
more points for the streamer, allowing viewers to see a variety of novel monsters. Viewer points are
distributed based on specific game mechanics designed to foster interaction."
